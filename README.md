The weather chart, SonarQube, and Average coding hours charts are connected to the calendar.

Due to limitations in Meteostat, we can generate only 2-3 charts at a time.

If the SonarQube analysis states that thereâ€™s an error connecting, reload the page or paste the link again; it is an API timeout

The sentiment analysis chart is shown as in the picture; the commit analysis takes a while to load, after going from page to page it will load the chart with the latest updates automatically
